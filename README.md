LXKB is an open-source project that makes minimal keyboard with 60 keys.

# Introduction

### Who is it for?
For coders, writers and for everyone.
This allows for fast typing with minimal movement.
In addition, it minimizes the burden on the shoulder even for long time use.
You should use a minimal keyboard for shoulder health.
A 60% keyboard is best for that.
So, is LXKB different from the normal 60% keyboard?
It's in the aesthetics of this keyboard.
